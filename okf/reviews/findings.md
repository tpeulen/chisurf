# Code-review findings queue

The shared work queue between two scheduled jobs (see
[scheduled-jobs](/workflows/scheduled-jobs.md)):

- **`com.chisurf.review-code`** *appends* verified findings here (status `OPEN`).
- **`com.chisurf.fix-issues`** *consumes* them: picks one `OPEN` finding, fixes it
  behind a test+lint gate, and flips it to `FIXED` (or `WONTFIX` with a reason).

This is distinct from the curated [cleanup backlog](/specs/assessment.md): that is
the human-authored gap-vs-target list; this is the automated review↔fix channel.
Promote a recurring or structural finding into the assessment backlog by hand when
it deserves first-class tracking.

## Format

One finding per `###` block. `RF-NNN` ids increment monotonically; never reuse a
number. Keep each finding **small, specific, and independently fixable** — a
finding the fix job can close in one 30-minute, test-gated run.

```
### RF-001
- **Status:** OPEN | FIXED | WONTFIX
- **Severity:** S1 (correctness/crash) | S2 (contract/consistency) | S3 (cleanup)
- **Location:** path/to/file.py:LINE (symbol)
- **Finding:** one or two sentences — what is wrong and why, verified against the source.
- **Fix note:** (filled by the fix job) what was changed + the test that pins it, or why WONTFIX.
```

## Findings

### Review 2026-07-25 — phasor cursors, expression engine, canonical form

Slice: the three newest landings — `45dec1c9` (phasor cursors as regions),
`4e0ef54b` (safe expression engine), `fa5d649b` (canonical form / GaussianEngine).
The rotation convention claimed "bit-identical" in `45dec1c9` **does** match
(`EllipseROI.contains` rotates by `-angle`, the old cursor by `R(-a)`); the
degenerate-radius case does not. Findings RF-001..RF-006 below.

### RF-001
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S1 (correctness)
- **Location:** `chisurf/plugins/microscopy/img_pixel_phasor/analysis.py:355` (`mask_from_circular_cursor`) via `chisurf/core/roi/roi.py:410` (`EllipseROI.contains`)
- **Finding:** A zero-radius circular cursor now selects **every** pixel instead of none. `EllipseROI.contains` treats a zero radius as unbounded (`rx = self.rx if self.rx > 0 else np.inf`), so `(dx/inf)**2 + (dy/inf)**2 == 0 <= 1` is True everywhere. The pre-`45dec1c9` implementation computed `(g-cg)**2 + (s-cs)**2 <= 0.0`, i.e. essentially nothing. Verified: `mask_from_circular_cursor([0,0.5,1],[0,0.5,0],(0.5,0.5),0.0)` returns `[True, True, True]`. The elliptic path is inconsistent with this — `cursor_roi` explicitly raises `ValueError` on a zero semi-axis, but the circular path performs no such check, and `phasor.cursor_mask` happily accepts `radius: 0` from an RPC client or a spin box wound to its minimum. Result: a silently whole-plane gate feeding `pseudo_color`/fraction maps.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-002
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (contract)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/fitting/engine.py:599` (`GaussianEngine.form`)
- **Finding:** `form()` caches the canonical form in `self._form` and never invalidates it; the only resets are `__init__` and `run()`. `conditional()` calls `self.form()`, so once a form has been built, re-fitting the model (new optimum, new curvature) leaves `conditional()` silently answering from the stale posterior — no re-run, no warning, no staleness check. The base class has the `_ran`/`_require_run()` machinery for exactly this hazard, but `conditional()` bypasses it (deliberately — it is the "no re-run" fast path). Either tie `_form` to a fit/parameter version, or make `conditional()` state its precondition and `_require_run()`.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-003
- **Status:** FIXED
- **Severity:** S2 (missing invariant)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/fitting/canonical.py:82` (`CanonicalForm.from_moments`), used at `canonical.py:190,254`
- **Finding:** `CanonicalForm` indexes its scope by name (`index = {n: i for i, n in enumerate(self.names)}`) but never enforces that names are unique, and `from_moments` accepts duplicates without complaint. A duplicate silently resolves to the **last** occurrence: verified with scope `('tau','tau','x')` and variances `(0.01, 4.0, 1.0)`, `marginal(['tau'])` returns the second one (`mean 5.0, var 4.0`) and `condition({'tau': 2.0})` drops only the second, leaving a form still containing a variable named `'tau'`. `__mul__` already assumes uniqueness (it dedupes the union scope by name). Wrong answers, not an exception. The `GaussianEngine` path happens to be safe today (global fits prefix names with the fit index, `globalfit.py:151`), so this is a latent contract gap in a public, composable module — fix by validating in `from_moments`/`__post_init__`.
- **Fix note:** `CanonicalForm.__post_init__` now rejects a scope that repeats a name (`ValueError`, listing the repeats), which covers `from_moments`, direct construction and `marginal(keep)` with a duplicated entry alike; `from_moments` and `marginal` document the new `ValueError`. Pinned by `test/fitting/test_canonical_form.py::test_a_repeated_name_is_refused`, which exercises all three routes. Reproduced against `HEAD` first: scope `('tau','tau','x')` with variances `(0.01, 4.0, 1.0)` silently returned `mean 5.0, var 4.0` from `marginal(['tau'])` and left `'tau'` in scope after `condition({'tau': 2.0})`. `test/fitting/test_canonical_form.py` (16), `test_posterior_engine.py` (16), `test_factor_graph.py` (13), `test_posterior_api.py` (8), `test_collapsed_sampler.py` (8), `test_independent_components.py` (11), `test_covariance_errors.py` (11) and `test_frozen_structure.py` (14) all green; `ruff check` clean.

### RF-004
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (correctness trap)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/expressions.py:113` (`DEFAULT_CONSTANTS`) and `expressions.py:273` (`_RefRewriter.visit_Name`)
- **Finding:** `visit_Name` resolves a bare identifier against `policy.constants` **before** treating it as a reference, so a caller symbol whose name collides with a built-in constant is unreachable and silently replaced by the constant — with `validate_expression` reporting `ok=True`. `DEFAULT_CONSTANTS` contains `tau`, which in a time-resolved-fluorescence code base is *the* name for a lifetime. Verified: `evaluate_expression('tau * 2', {'tau': 5.0})` returns `12.566…` (= 4π), not `10.0`; `evaluate_expression('e + 0', {'e': 100.0})` returns `2.718…`. There is no escape hatch — quoting (`'tau'`) is the only workaround and it is undocumented. Either prefer the symbol table over constants when the name is present, or drop/rename `tau` and `e` in `DEFAULT_CONSTANTS` and warn on a shadowed name.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-005
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (consistency)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/fitting/engine.py:756` (`GaussianEngine.conditional`)
- **Finding:** `conditional()` hard-codes `low=mean - sd, high=mean + sd, p_value=0.68`, while every other interval in the module derives the multiplier from the requested coverage (`z = _normal_quantile(0.5 + 0.5 * p_value)` at lines 127, 509, 697). For the same nominal `p_value=0.68` the two disagree (`z ≈ 0.9945` vs a hard `1.0`), and `conditional()` accepts no `p_value` argument at all, so a 95 % conditional interval cannot be requested from the one engine whose selling point is cheap conditional queries.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-006
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (validation hole)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/expressions.py:271` (`_RefRewriter.visit_Name`)
- **Finding:** A whitelisted function name used outside a call is left in the AST as a plain `Name`, so a bare function name is accepted as a complete expression and evaluates to the callable itself. Verified: `validate_expression('sqrt', [])` returns `ok=True, refs=()` and `evaluate_expression('sqrt', {})` returns `<ufunc 'sqrt'>`. In the equation editor this marks the row ✓ green and lets a ufunc object flow into a derived data column instead of numbers. Not a sandbox escape (attribute access is still blocked), but the validator should reject a function reference that is not called.
- **Fix note:**

### Review 2026-07-25 (2) — RICS precision prediction, time-binned dynamic PDA

Slice: the two newest landings that carry physics — `2c3ea0317` (RICSPE port,
`chisurf/core/experiments/ics/precision.py`, 566 new lines) and `06b7340c2`
(time-binned dynamic PDA: reader segmentation + `k_ex` as a rate). Also read
`d230c59c1` (`ROI.to_indices`): the refactor is exactly equivalent to the
arithmetic it replaced (`selected[0] == iy0*nx+ix0`, `selected[-1] ==
(iy1-1)*nx+(ix1-1)`) — nothing to report there.

Method note: the two-point correlation `correlation_grid` is a useful control —
it is *exactly* invariant when every length is re-expressed in nm instead of µm,
which is what exposed RF-007. Findings RF-007..RF-011 below.

### RF-007
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S1 (wrong math)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/experiments/ics/precision.py:236` (`triple_correlation`, the `v15`/`t17`/`e3` block)
- **Finding:** The three-point correlation is **not dimensionless**, so its value depends on the unit lengths are expressed in — which a correlation function cannot. Verified by re-expressing the same physical situation in nm instead of µm (lengths ×s, `d` ×s²): `triple_correlation((3,2),(0,0),(3,2), …)` returns 0.01408 in µm, 0.02255 in nm — a factor 1.6 — while `correlation_grid` on the same rescaling is invariant to 1e-16. Isolating the factors shows `e1` and `e2` are invariant and **`e3` is the culprit**: its exponent `|v15|²/t17` scales as 1/s² (0.951 → 0.0095 → 9.5e-7 for s = 1, 10, 1000), i.e. it carries dimension L⁻². Two transcription errors are visible by inspection: inside `v15 = r1*(w²/4*t11 + 2*d*t2*t12) + r3*w⁴/16 + r2*t11` the first two terms are L⁵ and the third is L³; and `t17 = t16 * w⁶/64 * term7` is L¹² where |v15|² is L¹⁰ (compare the correct `e2`, where `|v13|²` and `t14` are both L⁶). Impact at the default µm units: `e3 = 0.62` instead of ~1, i.e. the shot-noise diagonal `term1` is off by ~1.6×; scaling `triple_correlation` by 1.6 moves the reported relative error of the test acquisition from 0.096 to 0.105, and zeroing it gives 0.094 — small at bright settings, larger wherever shot noise dominates. Re-derive against the reference `RICSPE` and pin with a unit-rescaling invariance test (which `correlation_grid` already passes).
- **Fix note:**

### RF-008
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (crash on valid input)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/experiments/ics/precision.py:505` (`rics_precision`, the 3-D `q` brightness correction)
- **Finding:** `root = math.sqrt(1.0 - beta)` with `beta = 1/alpha²` makes the 3-D branch crash for any focus that is not elongated: `w_z == w_r` (alpha = 1, beta = 1) divides by `root == 0` — verified `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero` — and `w_z < w_r` raises `ValueError: math domain error` from the sqrt. Neither is a genuine singularity: the limit exists and the function is smooth through alpha = 1. Verified by evaluating the same expression with `cmath`: q = 0.79796 at alpha = 1.5, 0.797959 at 1.000001, 0.797959 at 0.999999 and 0.79758 at 0.8 — continuous, real-valued and finite on both sides (for beta > 1, `atanh` of an imaginary argument is `i·atan`, and the `1/root` prefactor cancels it). The docstring documents only a `ValueError` for inconsistent scan timing, so this reaches the caller as a bare arithmetic error with no message.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-009
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (validation hole)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/experiments/ics/precision.py:485` (`rics_precision`), via `precision.py:385` (`correlation_covariance`, `denom`)
- **Finding:** Scan timing is validated (`pixel_time * nx > line_time` raises a clear `ValueError`), but the two other inputs that can only fail are not. `n_lags >= min(nx, ny)` makes `denom = (nx - xi) * … * f**4` zero: verified `rics_precision(10.0, …, nx=6, ny=6, n_lags=6)` → `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`, and `correlation_covariance(6, 6, 6, …)` the same, while `nx=8` still returns a matrix (whose smallest eigenvalue is -0.22, so `nearest_spd` is doing real work there rather than mopping up round-off). `diffusion_coefficient=0` divides by zero in `tau_c = w_r**2 / (4*d)`. Both are one-line guards next to the existing timing check; the defaults (`n_lags=6`, `nx=ny=64`) are safe, so this only bites a caller that shrinks the image or sweeps `D` down to zero.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-010
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (default contradicts its own docstring; biased result)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/models/pda/dynamic.py:209` (`PdaDynamicTwoStateModel.__init__`, `n_grid: int = 41`)
- **Finding:** The parameter docstring immediately below states "512 is accurate to ~1e-4 in the mean occupancy even at fast exchange. The previous default of 41 was sized for a direct density evaluation and **is far too coarse here**" — yet the default is still 41, and `grep -rn n_grid` shows **no caller anywhere passes it**, so every fit runs at the value the docstring condemns. The bias is real and grows with exchange: `two_state_occupation_quadrature(p1=0.3, K, n_nodes=n)` gives E[f] = 0.30252 / 0.33593 / 0.34200 at K = 1e3 / 1e4 / 1e6 for n=41, against 0.30000 / 0.30000 / 0.30942 at n=512 and 0.3 exactly at n=4096 — a 14 % error in the mean occupancy where the model's own `x1` says 0.3 (at `p1 = 0.5` symmetry hides it, which is why the shipped tests do not catch it). This matters more since `06b7340c2`: `k_ex` is now an absolute rate with `ub=1e9` Hz and `K = k_ex * T`, so the fast-exchange regime is easy to wander into. Either raise the default to 512 or correct the docstring — the two cannot both stand.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-011
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (user-visible setting silently ignored)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/experiments/pda/reader.py:626` (`PdaReader.read`, the `n_colors >= 3` branch) vs `pda.view.json` "Segmentation" panel
- **Finding:** The new `segmentation` choice is rendered unconditionally in the reader editor (the panel in `pda.view.json` carries no visibility condition), but the three-colour path `return`s at `reader.py:649` before `segmentation` is ever consulted — it is read only at line 666, in the two-colour loop. A user who selects "Fixed time bins (constant duration)" on a three-colour setup silently gets a burst search instead, and the `pda3c` payload built by `_three_color_curve` (`reader.py:195`) records neither `segmentation` nor `observation_time`, so nothing downstream can tell that the request was dropped — the same silent-disagreement failure the commit removed the `T_win` spinner to prevent. Either honour the setting on the tcPDA path, or gate the panel on `n_colors == 2` and say so.
- **Fix note:**

### GUI test 2026-07-25 — TCSPC lifetime fit walked through the main window

Driven headlessly through the real main window (experiment/setup combo boxes,
`macros.add_dataset`, `onAddFit`, the `ConvolveWidget` IRF selector,
`FittingControllerWidget.onRunFit`) on `test/data/tcspc/ibh_sample/`. The fit
itself is correct — χ²ᵣ = 1.63, τ = 4.2 ns with the Prompt as IRF — but the GUI
around it fails silently under a condition that costs the user their whole
session. See [usecases/tcspc-lifetime-fit](/usecases/tcspc-lifetime-fit.md).
Findings RF-012..RF-017 below.

### RF-012
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S1 (silent total loss of function)
- **Location:** `chisurf/gui/widgets/fitting/fitting_client.py:207` (`FittingClient._try_bootstrap_transport`, the `if not rpc_is_available(...)` branch)
- **Finding:** A second ChiSurf instance adopts the **first instance's** RPC server instead of starting its own, and then every fitting operation silently does nothing. The bootstrap only asks whether *something* answers on `127.0.0.1:{cmd_port}/{pub_port}` (default 8765/8766) and, if so, skips server creation and connects a `ChisurfClient` to it; the sole validation is `client.call("meta.ping", {})`, which any ChiSurf server answers. There is no check that the server owns *this* process's session. Verified this run: with a live `python -m chisurf` (PID 22424) holding 8765, a freshly started instance attached to it and `fit.list` returned `{'ok': True, 'fits': []}` while `session_state_from_live_chisurf()` in the same process listed the fit — so `fit.range.auto`, `fit.set_fit_range`, `fit.update`, `fit.run`, `model.finalize` and `fit.set_result_idx` all returned `"fit not found"`, each merely logged by `_try_rpc`. User-visible result: **Fit** returns in 0.03 s, χ²ᵣ stays `-0.0000`, no parameter moves, no error is shown. Re-running the identical driver with `cs_settings["mmfdb"]["cmd_port"] = 18765` fits correctly (χ²ᵣ 5.22, then 1.63 with the IRF), which isolates the cause. Two ChiSurf windows is an ordinary thing to do, and a stale `python -m chisurf.server` reproduces it just as well. Either bind a per-process/per-session port, or verify session ownership after `meta.ping` and fall back to an own embedded server when the identity does not match.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-013
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S1 (GUI displays a value the model does not have)
- **Location:** `chisurf/gui/widgets/fitting/fit_controller.py:907` (`FittingControllerWidget.onAutoFitRange`), same hole in `onFitRangeChanged` (`fit_controller.py:820`)
- **Finding:** The fit range is applied to the fit **only** through the RPC client; when that call fails the GUI keeps showing the range anyway. `onAutoFitRange` correctly falls back to a local `self.fit.data.data_reader.autofitrange(...)` for the *value*, writes it into the spin boxes (whose signals are blocked for the duration, so no `onFitRangeChanged` fires), then calls `fc.set_fit_range(...)`; the local assignment `self.fit.fit_range = (xmin, xmax)` sits in the `elif fc is None:` branch, so a *failed* RPC leaves the fit untouched. Verified: controller spin boxes read **522 / 3793** while `fit.fit_range == (0, 0)` and the plot annotation read `Range 0, 0`; `fit.run()` on that state raises `TypeError: Improper input: N=4 must not exceed M=(0,)` from `leastsqbound.py:436` because the range selects zero points. Typing the range in by hand does not recover it — `onFitRangeChanged` has the same RPC-only structure. The fallback must be on RPC *failure*, not only on RPC *absence*.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-014
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (success reported for work that did not happen)
- **Location:** `chisurf/gui/widgets/fitting/fit_controller.py:711-735` (`FittingControllerWidget._run_fit_impl`)
- **Finding:** `_run_fit_impl` treats "the RPC returned `None`" as success. `fc.run_fit(...)` swallows every failure inside `FittingClient._try_rpc` and returns `None`; only `OptimizationCancelled` is caught, so control falls into the `else:` branch, which logs **"Fitting finished!"**, sets `success = True`, closes the progress dialog with the text *"Fitting finished!"*, and records a `fit_run_finish` history entry with `"success": true`. Verified: with the fit unreachable over RPC (RF-012) the button reported a finished fit while χ²ᵣ stayed `-0.0` and no parameter changed; the only evidence of failure was an ERROR line in the log dock. Check the RPC result (`ok`/`chi2r`) and surface a failure to the user — a fit that did not run must not be recorded as a fit that did.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-015
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (crash from an offered choice)
- **Location:** `chisurf/gui/widgets/models/tcspc/convolve.py:120` (`ConvolveWidget.irf_select`) → `chisurf/macros/model.py:202` (`change_irf`)
- **Finding:** The IRF picker offers the auto-created **"Global Dataset"** (an `ExperimentDataGroup`, shown with data type `Global`) alongside the TCSPC curves, and selecting it raises an uncaught `AttributeError: ExperimentDataGroup object has no attribute 'x'` from `change_irf`, which does `DataCurve(x=irf_curve.x, y=irf_curve.y)` with no type check. Verified this run: the dialog listed `[(0, 'Global Dataset', 'Global'), (1, 'Decay_577D.txt', 'TCSPC'), (2, 'Prompt.txt', 'TCSPC')]` and clicking row 0 produced the traceback (twice — once via `handleSelectionChange`, once via the explicit `change_event`), after which the driver did not reach its next step. Two clicks from a freshly created fit. `ExperimentalDataSelector` filters on `isinstance(d.experiment, self.experiment)`, which does not exclude group datasets; filter to curve-like datasets, and make `change_irf` reject anything without `x`/`y` with a message instead of a traceback.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-016
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (clipped value — user reads the wrong number)
- **Location:** `chisurf/gui/widgets/models/tcspc/tcspc_convolve.ui` (the `FWHM` label + `lineEdit_2` row), rendered by `chisurf/gui/widgets/models/tcspc/convolve.py:50`
- **Finding:** In the **Convolve** section the `FWHM` label and its read-only value box collide with no spacing, and the box is clipped at the panel's right edge so the value loses its leading characters: with the Prompt IRF loaded, `fwhm = 0.2538` is set via `"%.3f" % v` = `"0.254"` but renders as **`.254`**; before the pick, `0.226` is likewise cut. Verified in two grabs of the widget at its natural width (463 px). A user reading `.254` cannot tell whether the leading digit was `0` or something else. Give the row a stretch/minimum width or move FWHM onto its own line.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-017
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (bare IndexError instead of a clear error)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/models/tcspc/nusiance.py:899` (`Convolve.__init__`, `dt = data.dx[0]`)
- **Finding:** `Convolve.__init__` indexes `data.dx[0]` with no guard on an empty array, so building a TCSPC model on a dataset that carries no points raises `IndexError: index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0` from four frames below the call. Verified this run by dispatching `fit.add` with the auto-created empty Global dataset and `model_name="Lifetime "` (the console/macro path — `MainWindow.onCurrentDatasetChanged` filters the toolbar's model list by the dataset's experiment, so the toolbar does not reach it): the traceback surfaced through `FitGroup.__init__` → `Fit.model` → `LifetimeModel.__init__`. Guard the empty case and raise a message naming the dataset.
- **Fix note:**
