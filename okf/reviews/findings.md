# Code-review findings queue

The shared work queue between two scheduled jobs (see
[scheduled-jobs](/workflows/scheduled-jobs.md)):

- **`com.chisurf.review-code`** *appends* verified findings here (status `OPEN`).
- **`com.chisurf.fix-issues`** *consumes* them: picks one `OPEN` finding, fixes it
  behind a test+lint gate, and flips it to `FIXED` (or `WONTFIX` with a reason).

This is distinct from the curated [cleanup backlog](/specs/assessment.md): that is
the human-authored gap-vs-target list; this is the automated review↔fix channel.
Promote a recurring or structural finding into the assessment backlog by hand when
it deserves first-class tracking.

## Format

One finding per `###` block. `RF-NNN` ids increment monotonically; never reuse a
number. Keep each finding **small, specific, and independently fixable** — a
finding the fix job can close in one 30-minute, test-gated run.

```
### RF-001
- **Status:** OPEN | FIXED | WONTFIX
- **Severity:** S1 (correctness/crash) | S2 (contract/consistency) | S3 (cleanup)
- **Location:** path/to/file.py:LINE (symbol)
- **Finding:** one or two sentences — what is wrong and why, verified against the source.
- **Fix note:** (filled by the fix job) what was changed + the test that pins it, or why WONTFIX.
```

## Findings
