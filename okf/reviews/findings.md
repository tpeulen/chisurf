# Code-review findings queue

The shared work queue between two scheduled jobs (see
[scheduled-jobs](/workflows/scheduled-jobs.md)):

- **`com.chisurf.review-code`** *appends* verified findings here (status `OPEN`).
- **`com.chisurf.fix-issues`** *consumes* them: picks one `OPEN` finding, fixes it
  behind a test+lint gate, and flips it to `FIXED` (or `WONTFIX` with a reason).

This is distinct from the curated [cleanup backlog](/specs/assessment.md): that is
the human-authored gap-vs-target list; this is the automated review↔fix channel.
Promote a recurring or structural finding into the assessment backlog by hand when
it deserves first-class tracking.

## Format

One finding per `###` block. `RF-NNN` ids increment monotonically; never reuse a
number. Keep each finding **small, specific, and independently fixable** — a
finding the fix job can close in one 30-minute, test-gated run.

```
### RF-001
- **Status:** OPEN | FIXED | WONTFIX
- **Severity:** S1 (correctness/crash) | S2 (contract/consistency) | S3 (cleanup)
- **Location:** path/to/file.py:LINE (symbol)
- **Finding:** one or two sentences — what is wrong and why, verified against the source.
- **Fix note:** (filled by the fix job) what was changed + the test that pins it, or why WONTFIX.
```

## Findings

### Review 2026-07-25 — phasor cursors, expression engine, canonical form

Slice: the three newest landings — `45dec1c9` (phasor cursors as regions),
`4e0ef54b` (safe expression engine), `fa5d649b` (canonical form / GaussianEngine).
The rotation convention claimed "bit-identical" in `45dec1c9` **does** match
(`EllipseROI.contains` rotates by `-angle`, the old cursor by `R(-a)`); the
degenerate-radius case does not. Findings RF-001..RF-006 below.

### RF-001
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S1 (correctness)
- **Location:** `chisurf/plugins/microscopy/img_pixel_phasor/analysis.py:355` (`mask_from_circular_cursor`) via `chisurf/core/roi/roi.py:410` (`EllipseROI.contains`)
- **Finding:** A zero-radius circular cursor now selects **every** pixel instead of none. `EllipseROI.contains` treats a zero radius as unbounded (`rx = self.rx if self.rx > 0 else np.inf`), so `(dx/inf)**2 + (dy/inf)**2 == 0 <= 1` is True everywhere. The pre-`45dec1c9` implementation computed `(g-cg)**2 + (s-cs)**2 <= 0.0`, i.e. essentially nothing. Verified: `mask_from_circular_cursor([0,0.5,1],[0,0.5,0],(0.5,0.5),0.0)` returns `[True, True, True]`. The elliptic path is inconsistent with this — `cursor_roi` explicitly raises `ValueError` on a zero semi-axis, but the circular path performs no such check, and `phasor.cursor_mask` happily accepts `radius: 0` from an RPC client or a spin box wound to its minimum. Result: a silently whole-plane gate feeding `pseudo_color`/fraction maps.

### RF-002
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (contract)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/fitting/engine.py:599` (`GaussianEngine.form`)
- **Finding:** `form()` caches the canonical form in `self._form` and never invalidates it; the only resets are `__init__` and `run()`. `conditional()` calls `self.form()`, so once a form has been built, re-fitting the model (new optimum, new curvature) leaves `conditional()` silently answering from the stale posterior — no re-run, no warning, no staleness check. The base class has the `_ran`/`_require_run()` machinery for exactly this hazard, but `conditional()` bypasses it (deliberately — it is the "no re-run" fast path). Either tie `_form` to a fit/parameter version, or make `conditional()` state its precondition and `_require_run()`.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-003
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (missing invariant)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/fitting/canonical.py:82` (`CanonicalForm.from_moments`), used at `canonical.py:190,254`
- **Finding:** `CanonicalForm` indexes its scope by name (`index = {n: i for i, n in enumerate(self.names)}`) but never enforces that names are unique, and `from_moments` accepts duplicates without complaint. A duplicate silently resolves to the **last** occurrence: verified with scope `('tau','tau','x')` and variances `(0.01, 4.0, 1.0)`, `marginal(['tau'])` returns the second one (`mean 5.0, var 4.0`) and `condition({'tau': 2.0})` drops only the second, leaving a form still containing a variable named `'tau'`. `__mul__` already assumes uniqueness (it dedupes the union scope by name). Wrong answers, not an exception. The `GaussianEngine` path happens to be safe today (global fits prefix names with the fit index, `globalfit.py:151`), so this is a latent contract gap in a public, composable module — fix by validating in `from_moments`/`__post_init__`.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-004
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S2 (correctness trap)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/expressions.py:113` (`DEFAULT_CONSTANTS`) and `expressions.py:273` (`_RefRewriter.visit_Name`)
- **Finding:** `visit_Name` resolves a bare identifier against `policy.constants` **before** treating it as a reference, so a caller symbol whose name collides with a built-in constant is unreachable and silently replaced by the constant — with `validate_expression` reporting `ok=True`. `DEFAULT_CONSTANTS` contains `tau`, which in a time-resolved-fluorescence code base is *the* name for a lifetime. Verified: `evaluate_expression('tau * 2', {'tau': 5.0})` returns `12.566…` (= 4π), not `10.0`; `evaluate_expression('e + 0', {'e': 100.0})` returns `2.718…`. There is no escape hatch — quoting (`'tau'`) is the only workaround and it is undocumented. Either prefer the symbol table over constants when the name is present, or drop/rename `tau` and `e` in `DEFAULT_CONSTANTS` and warn on a shadowed name.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-005
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (consistency)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/fitting/engine.py:756` (`GaussianEngine.conditional`)
- **Finding:** `conditional()` hard-codes `low=mean - sd, high=mean + sd, p_value=0.68`, while every other interval in the module derives the multiplier from the requested coverage (`z = _normal_quantile(0.5 + 0.5 * p_value)` at lines 127, 509, 697). For the same nominal `p_value=0.68` the two disagree (`z ≈ 0.9945` vs a hard `1.0`), and `conditional()` accepts no `p_value` argument at all, so a 95 % conditional interval cannot be requested from the one engine whose selling point is cheap conditional queries.
- **Fix note:**

### RF-006
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** S3 (validation hole)
- **Location:** `chisurf/core/expressions.py:271` (`_RefRewriter.visit_Name`)
- **Finding:** A whitelisted function name used outside a call is left in the AST as a plain `Name`, so a bare function name is accepted as a complete expression and evaluates to the callable itself. Verified: `validate_expression('sqrt', [])` returns `ok=True, refs=()` and `evaluate_expression('sqrt', {})` returns `<ufunc 'sqrt'>`. In the equation editor this marks the row ✓ green and lets a ufunc object flow into a derived data column instead of numbers. Not a sandbox escape (attribute access is still blocked), but the validator should reject a function reference that is not called.
